# TypeScript Track

## About

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from the [Exercism
TypeScript track](https://exercism.io/tracks/typescript).
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, and it's taking the web development
to the next level. It's a statically typed language that compiles to plain
JavaScript. It's a great tool for building large applications.

## Why TypeScript?

I'm learning TypeScript because it's a superset of JavaScript, and I'm learning
JavaScript because it's the language of the web. I'm currently taking part in
a Full Stack JavaScript bootcamp, and I'm using TypeScript to improve my
Web Development skills.
